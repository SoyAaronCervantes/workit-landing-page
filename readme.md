> # Workit Landing Page
> 
> Frontend Mentor

This is my second challenge from this [site](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home).

The more I do this challenges, the more I learn and relearn about other things, that I don't have the opportunity to use on my daily job.

## Description
This project is a landing page for a fictional company called Workit. The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can check the challenge [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/workit-landing-page-2fYnyle5lu).

It was built with Vite, React, Typescript, Material 3, and pure CSS.
Some sections, as I always used to said for each part of the landing page, are split on React components.

All the website is responsive, and the design is fully responsive.

## What I learned
I learnt 3 things on this project:
- **Clip-path**: Sometimes, you don't have the opportunity to use it, and also, check how does it works, it's kind of weird,
but as always, [there are some guides, that can help you to understand it](https://ishadeed.com/article/clip-path/).
- **Visibility**: This property helps a lot, I reminded just because I wanted to use clip-path, but it's a good property to use.
It helps me, to show the image over the curve at the bottom of the first section.
- **Media Queries**: I haven't have the opportunity to build a dark mode website yet on my daily job, so I used this opportunity to do it.
I have to admit that I used Material 3 Builder to make an idea about what do I want to do, and then
try to replicate some rules that they follow for each color variable.

I think on my next challenge, I'm going to look for something that helps to use container queries.
I used once, but I want something more challenging, meanwhile I grow my portfolio, personal projects, and 
improve my Frontend skills.
